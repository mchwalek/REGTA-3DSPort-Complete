# reLCS for New Nintendo 3DS

Based on [reStories by knackers4 and its contributors](https://github.com/knackers4/res).

**The main story has been completed on a physical New Nintendo 3DS.**
Side missions and optional activities are not yet verified.

Requires a New Nintendo 3DS, New 3DS XL or New 2DS XL and converted **PS2 LCS
data**. Old 3DS systems are not supported. Build the executable yourself;
full game data and the compiler are not included.

[Shared build guide](../README.md#building-from-source) ·
[Full changelog](../README.md#grand-theft-auto-liberty-city-stories--relcs)

## Runtime layout

The executable and original game data are installed separately:

```text
sdmc:/3ds/relcs.3dsx          Homebrew Launcher executable
sdmc:/3ds/relcs/              extracted and prepared LCS data
sdmc:/3ds/relcs/userfiles/    settings and save files
```

The CIA uses the same `sdmc:/3ds/relcs/` data directory. Installing a CIA does
not install the original models, map, scripts or audio.

Older development builds used `sdmc:/3ds/restories/`. Move its `userfiles`
folder into `sdmc:/3ds/relcs/` before retiring the old directory.

## Preparing PS2 game data

Start with your own PS2 copy and the upstream
[reLCS Asset Converter](https://github.com/knackers4/res/releases/tag/relcs).
The reStories release provides it as `reLCSAssetConverter.exe`, a Windows
tool for converting the PS2 assets into the layout reLCS expects. Follow the
[upstream instructions](https://github.com/knackers4/res#how-can-i-try-it)
for that step; simply extracting the ISO is not the same as converting its
assets.

Use the repository-level setup helper from the root of
REGTA-3DSPort-Complete:

```sh
./scripts/setup-game.sh relcs "/path/to/extracted/LCS" "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
```

With no arguments, `setup-game.sh` also provides an interactive prompt.
The final argument must be the mounted card's `/3ds` directory, not the volume
root.

The prepared PS2 data directory must contain at least:

```text
DATA/gta_lcs.DAT
models/gta3.img
AUDIO/sfx.RAW
AUDIO/MUSIC/*.VB
AUDIO/NEWS/*.VB
AUDIO/CUTSCENE/*.VB
```

The setup helper checks and copies your PS2 data, then applies selected files
from the included `gamefiles/relcs` folder at the repository root:
`AUDIO/MUSIC`, `movies` and `txd/LOADSC0.TXD`.
See the [data guide](../README.md#preparing-game-data) for details.
Your original files and existing destination saves are preserved.

### Audio conversion

PS2 stream files are not copied directly to the SD card. The setup helper builds
the included VB decoder and uses `ffmpeg` to create formats chosen for New 3DS:

- MUSIC: 24 kHz mono IMA ADPCM WAV;
- NEWS: 24 kHz mono MP3;
- CUTSCENE: 24 kHz mono MP3;
- gameplay effects and speech: merged `sfx.RAW` plus `sfx.sdt`.

The source VB streams and split sound banks are not needed on the SD card
after conversion.

Required host tools for data preparation:

- a POSIX-compatible shell;
- `rsync`;
- a C++ compiler;
- `ffmpeg`.

## Building reLCS

Install the [shared build dependencies](../README.md#building-from-source)
first, including devkitARM r55 / GCC 10.2. Both Linux and macOS require building
the SDK: follow the [source-build guide](../README.md#linux-and-macos-build-r55-from-official-sources)
instead of the old downloader.
Then run
these commands from the repository root:

```sh
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
export DEVKITARM=/path/to/devkitARM-r55

./scripts/verify-layout.sh
./scripts/build.sh relcs
```

Outputs:

```text
stories/build/relcs.elf
stories/build/relcs.3dsx
```

Use devkitARM r55 / GCC 10.2; newer versions can produce builds that crash.

To install the freshly built 3DSX:

```sh
./scripts/install-3dsx.sh relcs "/Volumes/SD/3ds"
```

This copies `stories/build/relcs.3dsx` to `/3ds/relcs.3dsx` without replacing
the prepared data or save directory.

## CIA package metadata

The [CIA packager](../README.md#cia-packaging) supports the custom icon,
animated Leone Sentinel banner and banner audio. The finished CGFX, encoded
audio and icon are included in `packaging/prebuilt`.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Short title | `GTALCS For Nintendo 3DS` |
| Long title | `Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories` |
| Title ID | `00040000002F6200` |
| Product code | `CTR-P-RLCS` |
| Data directory | `sdmc:/3ds/relcs/` |

The CIA requires the same SD game data as the 3DSX.

## Nintendo 3DS controls

The prompts use Nintendo button names. A confirms or buys in menus and shops;
B returns or leaves. Weapon and vehicle actions depend on what Toni is doing.

### On foot

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Circle Pad | Move Toni |
| C-stick | Move the camera |
| A | Sprint; zoom in in supported weapon sights |
| B | Jump; zoom out in supported weapon sights |
| Y | Enter a vehicle or perform the current vehicle interaction |
| X | Fire or use the equipped weapon |
| R | Aim; third-person lock-on when a target is available |
| Tap L while holding R | Free aim; adjust with the Circle Pad |
| ZL / ZR | Cycle weapons; change target while locked on where supported |
| L | Re-centre the camera |
| R3 touch button | Look behind |

## 3DS text cheat keyboard

During gameplay, hold:

```text

```

Enter a code without spaces. Codes are case-insensitive. The keyboard is only
available during gameplay.

> [!WARNING]
> Cheats can change statistics, world behaviour and save-game state. The game
> may mark the session as cheated or show its normal save warning. Keep a clean
> save backup when testing cheats.

The main codes below are the GTA-style phrases written for this port. The short
aliases still work and trigger the same effects. Enter either one without spaces.

[Full changelog →](../README.md#grand-theft-auto-liberty-city-stories--relcs)

## Final-mission music

The edited 'Chase' tracks belong at:

```text
relcs/AUDIO/MUSIC/CHASE_FM.WAV
relcs/AUDIO/MUSIC/CHASE_LOOP.WAV
```

The opening starts with the first gameplay objective, or at the boat checkpoint
when restarting through the hospital taxi. When it finishes, the loop begins.
The confrontation with Massimo fades the current music to silence, then the
helicopter objective starts the edited climax once. Skipping the scene also
switches to the climax. The helicopter crash fades and stops the track.

Ordinary cutscenes lower the music to 50% without pausing it. Radio switching
is disabled during the mission, and the song name is shown while driving.

## Texture conversion and performance

The 3DS renderer uses a native `models/txd.img`/`models/txd.dir` cache. If the
cache is not present, first launch may spend a long time converting textures. Do not remove
a known-good cache merely because the original TXD files remain beside it.

Dense vegetation, traffic and complex cutscenes can still reduce frame rate.

## Save data

Native 3DS saves are stored in:

```text
sdmc:/3ds/relcs/userfiles/
```

Back up this folder before changing scripts or converting saves. PS2 saves need
conversion; renaming a file is not enough.

## Known limitations

- Main-story completion has been verified on real hardware; side missions and
  other optional activities have not yet been verified.
- New 3DS-family hardware only.
- The initial native texture build can be slow.
- Dense vegetation and complex real-time cutscenes can still reduce frame rate.
- The pause map and local radar can differ slightly in alignment.
- Desktop ASI/CLEO plugins and binary patches are not compatible.
- Some unused upstream features and debug cheats remain unimplemented.

## Reporting bugs

Please open an Issue with:

- Mission/location and steps to reproduce the problem.
- Build or commit, console model, and CIA or 3DSX.
- Expected and actual behaviour; whether restarting helps.
- Any cheats or mods used.
- Crash dump, screenshots/video and a save before the problem, when available.

Freezes and gameplay bugs can be reported without a crash dump.

## Credits and legal notice

The LCS code is based on
[reStories (`knackers4/res`)](https://github.com/knackers4/res), which also
provides the [PS2 asset converter](https://github.com/knackers4/res/releases/tag/relcs).
Thanks to knackers4 and the reStories contributors for that foundation.

This port also builds on re3/reVC, the community Nintendo 3DS port, librw,
devkitPro, libctru, Citro3D, OpenAL Soft, mpg123 and their contributors.

The code is intended for educational, documentation and modding purposes. It
does not distribute the original game and does not encourage piracy or
commercial use. Preserve upstream credit and keep derivative source available.
